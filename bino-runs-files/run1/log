/---- Run 1 definition of bit mask ----/
- Bit 1: Standard stars
- Bit 2: Standard galaxies
- Bit 3: Not used
- Bit 4: NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3050, Flat FoM
- Bit 5: NDM Local depths, N_tot = 3050, Flat FoM
- Bit 6: NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3050, Redshift dependent FoM. More precisely. Quadratic dependency
- Bit 7: NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3050, Flat FoM, f_NoZ = 0.5 (rather than 0.25)
- Bit 8: RF tuned for 2400 deg
- Bit 9: RF tuned for 3000 deg
- Bit 10: RF tuned for 3000 deg with an additional gmag cut.
- Bit 11: RF ?
# Note that Bit 4-7 corresponds to NDM and 8-11 to RF. RF priority is mutually exclusive whereas NDM has sizeable intersection.

Note: It is important to note that the NDM selection algorithm used here is different from other versions. Therefore, when studying the precision of various selections, the most up-to-date version should be used.
